## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am Steven van Beelen, the Lead Developer of [Axon Framework](https://github.com/AxonFramework) at [AxonIQ](https://www.axoniq.io/).
As such, most of my work can be found there, with a heavy focus on the Framework's [repository](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework), of course.

Given my focus, I have extensive experience with Message-Driven Architecture, CQRS, Event Sourcing, and Domain-Driven Design.
I am convinced that following a messaging paradigm throughout your applications provides the highest level of flexibility you will ever need.
Please reach out if you are up for a discussion on that or looking for guidance!

Next to my development efforts on Axon Framework, I:
- plan, discuss, and implement features and enhancements for Axon Framework with team members and contributors.
- coordinate (most) activity on the open-source repositories of [Axon Framework](https://github.com/AxonFramework/).
- provide online and offline training in anything Axon-related (see [AxonIQ Academy](https://academy.axoniq.io/) for some training material I have made)
- consult people on using Axon Framework on our [forum](https://discuss.axoniq.io/), StackOverflow, and GitHub.
- go on stage to talk about all this when I get requested/selected for a conference/meet-up.
- work on [AxonIQ Console](https://console.axoniq.io/) as it further helps Axon users.

I graduated from the [Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl), where I achieved my Master's Degree in Computer Science.
My specialization was "High-Performance Distributed Computing," within which I focused on [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Hama](https://hama.apache.org/) during my thesis.
